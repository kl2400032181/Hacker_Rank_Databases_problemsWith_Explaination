Using which language can a user request information from a database ?
 
Query
Relational
Structural
Compiler
Answer: Query(DQL)
Explanation: A Query Language is used to request information from a database.

Query: A statement written by the user to retrieve or manipulate data.

Example: SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most popular query language.

Example SQL query:

SELECT Name, Age FROM Student WHERE Age > 18;


Relational: Refers to the relational model of databases (tables, rows, columns), not the language itself.

Structural: Not a database language — possibly confused with “Data Definition Language (DDL)” structure.

Compiler: Converts code into machine language; unrelated to requesting data from a database.

✅ So, when a user wants to request information, they write a query.
Key Takeaways for Exams / Interviews

Query = Request data from a database.

SQL is the most widely used query language (Structured Query Language).

Types of SQL commands you might be asked about:

DQL (Data Query Language): SELECT (used to request data)

DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP

Remember: User interaction with the database is always through queries.

Interview Tip:

They might ask: “What type of language lets users request data?” → Answer: Query / DQL.

They may differentiate query language vs programming language vs DDL.
