Which one of the following is a procedural language ?

Domain relational calculus
Tuple relational calculus
Relational algebra
Query language
ChatGPT said:

The correct answer is:

Relational algebra ✅

Explanation

In database theory:

Procedural Language:

Specifies how to get the result.

You tell the database step by step what operations to perform.

Non-Procedural Language:

Specifies what result is needed, not how to compute it.

The system figures out the procedure.

Examples from your options:

Option	Procedural / Non-Procedural	Explanation
Domain Relational Calculus	Non-Procedural	You describe what you want, not how to get it.
Tuple Relational Calculus	Non-Procedural	Declarative; specifies the properties of the desired result.
Relational Algebra	Procedural	Specifies a sequence of operations (select, project, join, union, etc.) to get the result.
Query Language (like SQL)	Non-Procedural	You specify what to retrieve; the DBMS decides the execution plan.
Key Takeaways for Exams / Interviews

Procedural vs Non-Procedural:

Procedural: You tell how to compute (Relational Algebra).

Non-Procedural: You tell what you want (Relational Calculus, SQL).

Relational Algebra = Step-by-step operations → Procedural → used as foundation for query optimization.

Interview Tip:

If asked “Which is procedural?”, think “Step by step operations” → Relational Algebra.

Tuple/Domain Calculus = Declarative / Non-Procedural.

This distinction is important for query processing, optimization, and database theory questions.
