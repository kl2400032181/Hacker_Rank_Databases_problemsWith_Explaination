Consider the following data table named Student.

Student Name    Number  Sex  
Ben             3412    M  
Dan             1234    M

What is the count of rows returned in the following relational selection?
σ(Number<3000)(Student)

Only enter a single integer. Do not include any extra spaces or newlines.
Answer:2
Explanation: Relational Selection (σ condition)

Definition: Choose rows from a table that satisfy a given condition.

SQL Link: SELECT * FROM Student WHERE Number < 3000;

Important: Pay attention to:

Comparison operators (<, >, =, <=, >=).

Data types—ensure numeric comparisons are not accidentally string comparisons.

Interview Angle:

Know how the WHERE clause filters rows.

Understand indexing: if Number is indexed, selection is faster.
