Which is a join condition contains an equality operator?

Equijoins

Answer:Equijoins
Explaination: Equijoin: Matches rows where a column from one table equals a column from another table (=).

Cartesian join: Returns all possible combinations of rows (no condition).

Natural join: Implicitly matches columns with the same name (also uses equality internally, but itâ€™s considered a special case of equijoin).

Left join: Includes all rows from the left table and matches from the right; it can have any condition, not necessarily equality.
