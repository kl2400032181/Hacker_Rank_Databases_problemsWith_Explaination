In precedence of set operators the expression is evaluated from:

Depends on the expression
Left to right
Right to left
From user specification
Answer: Left to right 
Explanation: Key Takeaway for Exams / Interviews

If the question asks “In precedence of set operators, expressions are evaluated …”, many textbooks/MCQs accept “Left to right” because UNION, EXCEPT, and multiple same operators are evaluated left to right.

But technically, mixed operators obey precedence rules, and parentheses can override.
INTERSECT has higher precedence → evaluated first

Then UNION with the next query

So here, operator precedence matters, but for operators of the same type, evaluation is left to right.
